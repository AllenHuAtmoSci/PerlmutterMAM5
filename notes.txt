This branch adds pm-cpu to maint-1.0, but there are still some changes
required to get tests running.

There are 2 changes in files under submodules, so will have to work out best way to fix.

These are changes needed with higher version of GNU (which is all that is avail on PM)

1) Need a change here to build. this is already done in master, but there are other changes we don't need --
can just update source with the interface changes needed, by doing this:

cp ODEMod.F90 components/clm/src/external_models/sbetr/src/betr/betr_math/ODEMod.F90

2) Needed to work-around issue with solver during runtime. This change modifies compiler
flags for ALL MPAS sources which is not necessary, but unable to only affect one source in MPAS
In current master, we build one MPAS source file with a compiler flag to turn off very specific optimization,
however, in maint-1.0, the CMake logic is different and I can't do the same thing in Depends.
But what I can do is add a flag here (which may need more guards) that turns off the optimization
for all MPAS source files.

cp Makefile.in.ACME components/mpas-source/src/Makefile.in.ACME

-----------------------
Here are two places that were failing with runtime segfault in DEBUG (for some tests)
due to the compiler looking-ahead and trying to parse an experession B that should only be evaluated if A is true.
I think these changes are safe:

cp RtmMod.F90 components/mosart/src/riverroute/RtmMod.F90
cp micro_mg2_0.F90 components/cam/src/physics/cam/micro_mg2_0.F90

We can decide how important fixes like these are. I don't see a fix in current master
at these locations, but it's possible the code flow doesn't happen same way in maint-1.0
