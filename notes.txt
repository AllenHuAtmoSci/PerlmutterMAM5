There are 2 changes in files under submodules that are not easy to change.

These are changes needed with higher version of GNU (all that is avail on PM)

Need a change here to build. this is already done in master, but there are other changes we don't need --
can just update source with the interface changes needed

cp ODEMod.F90 components/clm/src/external_models/sbetr/src/betr/betr_math/ODEMod.F90

needed to work-around issue with solver during runtime. this change modifies compiler
flags for ALL MPAS sources which is not necessary, but unable to only affect one source in MPAS
in current master, we build one MPAS source file with a compiler flag to turn off very specific optimization,
however, in maint-1.0, the CMake logic is different and I can't do the same thing in Depends.
But what I can do is add a flag here (which may need more guards) that turns off the optimization
for all MPAS source files.

cp Makefile.in.ACME components/mpas-source/src/Makefile.in.ACME

-----------------------
Here are two places that were failing with runtime segfault in DEBUG due to the compiler looking-ahead
and trying to parse an experession B that should only be evaluated if A is true.

cp RtmMod.F90 components/mosart/src/riverroute/RtmMod.F90
cp micro_mg2_0.F90 components/cam/src/physics/cam/micro_mg2_0.F90

We can decide how important fixes like these are. I don't see a fix in current master
at these locations, but it's possible the code flow doesn't happen same way in maint-1.0
